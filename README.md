# Techdegree Project3 - An Online Registration Form
#### Skills: HTML, CSS
#### Tools: W3C CSS & HTML validator
#### Concept: mobile-first responsive website, flexbox
#### Description: Build a responsive online registration form using HTML and CSS. This layout demonstrates my understanding of responsive design by adjusting to accommodate small and medium screen sizes. I wrote CSS to style the page for the small mobile device first and then use min-width media queries. I also try to use the flexbox instead of float to layout the structure. 
### Main Difficulties: Chrome couldn't take the padding of the select element, so be careful when addressing it.
