# Techdegree Project3 - An Online Registration Form

## Skills
* HTML
* CSS

## Tools
* W3C CSS 
* HTML validator

## Concept 
Mobile-first Responsive Website, flexbox

# Description
Build a responsive online registration form using HTML and CSS. This layout demonstrates my understanding of responsive design by adjusting to accommodate small and medium screen sizes. I wrote CSS to style the page for the small mobile device first and then use min-width media queries. I also try to use the flexbox instead of float to layout the structure. 

## Difficulties
Chrome couldn't take the padding of the select element, so be careful when addressing it.

## Inspection
Google DevTools
