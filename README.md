# Techdegree Project3 - An Online Registration Form

## Concept 
Mobile-first Responsive Website, flexbox , HTML form

## Description
Build a responsive online registration form using HTML and CSS based on mockups. This layout demonstrates my understanding of responsive design by adjusting to accommodate a mobile and desktop version of the form using media queries. 

I wrote CSS to style the page for the small mobile device first and then use min-width media queries. I also tried to use the flexbox instead of float to layout the structure. 

## Difficulties
Chrome couldn't take the padding of the select element, so be careful when addressing it.
